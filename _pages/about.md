I am a cyber security professional working as a full-time Reverse Engineer for Peraton and part-time as a Lead Host Analyst for an Army Reserves Cyber Protection Team. I also freelance as a security researcher for Synack Red Team.

What is The Butcher Shop? When I was growing up I was a wrestler and my favorite pinning move was called *The Butcher*. I thought it only made sense to merge the associated meaning of the name with my skillset in reverse engineering and computer exploitation. This site will host all my articles on cyber security research for the forseeable future.

Feel free to reach out if you have general questions or are in need of mentorship.
