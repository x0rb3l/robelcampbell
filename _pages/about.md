I am a cleared professional working as a full-time Principal Cyber Protection Engineer for Peraton and part-time as a Lead Host Analyst for an Army Reserves Cyber Protection Team. I also freelance as a security researcher for Synack Red Team.

What is The Butcher Shop? When I was growing up I was a wrestler and my favorite pinning move was called *The Butcher*. I thought it only made sense to merge the associated meaning of the name with my skillset in computer exploitation. This site will be where I host all my articles on cyber security research.

Connect with me on LinkedIn and shoot me an email if you have questions or need some mentorship.
