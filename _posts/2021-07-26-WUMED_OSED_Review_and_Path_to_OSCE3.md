In my last two posts, I discussed my experience with AWAE/OSWE and ETBD/OSEP and how they are two of the trinity in obtaining the coveted *OSCE<sup>3</sup>* certification. This post is aimed at discussing my experience with the third and final course: *Windows User Mode Exploit Development* (WUMED) and *Offensive Security Exploit Developer* (OSED) exam.

ETBD focuses on breaching a corporate network perimeter, bypassing various antivirus solutions, abusing Windows Active Directory, owning the domain and more. You can find out more in the course [syllabus](https://www.offensive-security.com/documentation/PEN300-Syllabus.pdf).
